# Styline

#### Description

Styline (created by Nicole, Gabriel, and Keisha) is an Android application that virtualize a wardrobe. Inspired by Cher Horowitz's digitalized closet, users can mix and match outfits while using pictures of their physical clothing. Our goal was to simplify the process of choosing outfits, especially for users with an extensive clothing collection or for individuals who do not have time to pair outfits together.
